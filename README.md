# NYC Subway Time LED Matrix Display
## Overview

This project was derived from https://github.com/techytobias/NYC-Subway-Display/. Changes to this version:
- Displays 4 screens on a loop related to trains at 34th st Herald Square: BDFM Uptown, BDFM Downtown, NQRW Uptown, NQRW Downtown.
- Removal of the disruptions screen.
- The MTA no longer requires API keys to access the subway feed.
- Utilizes a Raspberry Pi Zero W with no driver (underpowered for this project, likely causing the screen flickering).
- Inclusion of Fusion 360 files for enclosure

#### Capabilities
- Display times for arriving uptown and downtown trains at any NYC subway station
- Rotate through time displays for multiple stations

- [Demo](display_demo.mov)

## Materials
- Raspberry Pi Zero W (again, unpowered for this application)
- SD Card (8GB Class 10 or better)
- LED Matrix. I used [this Adafruit one, which is 64 x 32 with a 2.5mm led spacing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5036)
- Adequate power for the display and Pi -- I used [this adapter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1466).

## Before You Begin This Guide
- Follow [this setup](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/tree/master) guide to get your LED Matrix Panel working. (As far as I can tell, this is the most popular library for these panels).
- Wire up your LED Matrix following that guide depending on your hardware.
- Follow the [Python setup instructions](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/tree/master/bindings/python#python-3) as well.
- Install Headless Raspbian with user display and hostname displaypi. Also remember to enable SSH.
    - You can use a different username/hostname, but you may need to modify different aspects of this code.
- Enable SSH
- Don't move onto this project until you have [Demo -D0 completed (the rotating cube)](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#lets-do-it).

## Creating the display
- At this point, I'm assuming that you have the rotating cube demo file working. Your file structure should look like /home/display/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/bindings/python/samples/
- We will be keeping this file structure during this guide for the sake of simplicity.
#### Transferring Files
- Move the files rundisplay.py , mtacalls2.py, stops.csv , and packageinst.sh to /home/displau/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/bindings/python/samples/
    - I used scp to move the files over.
#### Installing Python dependencies
- In your SSH window, change directory to our main directory
    - cd /home/display/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/bindings/python/samples/
- Run packageinst.sh (You may need to make the file executable using the command below)
    - sudo chmod +x packageinst.sh
    - sudo ./packageinst.sh
- Check your work. You should see lots of new folders in the /home/display/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/bindings/python/ directory.
### Running the code
- First, make rundisplay.py executable
    - sudo chmod +x rundisplay.py
- Then, run the code (Modify this code as needed for your display).
    - sudo ./rundisplay.py --led-rows=32 --led-cols=64 --led-slowdown-gpio=2 -b=30
- You should see train times appear after a few minutes of the code running. You should see the times appear on your terminal window as they are loaded by the API as well.
- If this works, jump to the customization section. If not, follow the troubleshooting section.

## Troubleshooting
#### Basic Troubleshooting
- Ensure whatever file you are trying to run is executable
    - sudo chmod +x filename.abc
- Ensure all python packages are loaded
- Ensure you entered your API key probably
- Recheck whether you can run the rotating cube demo file

#### More Advanced Troubleshooting
- edit mtacalls.py using nano to add the below line:
    - print(totalstationtimes("A41"))
- then, run mtacalls.py
    - sudo python3 mtacalls.py
- you should see train times print out after a few seconds. If you don't, and you see a python error, search the error on stack exchange.

## Customization
- Use stops.csv to find the code for your desired station(s). Use only the first three letters -- the N and S will be used for the uptown and downtown screens.
    - e.g, 232 for Borough Hall, or A41 for Jay St-Metrotech.
    - Note that the station names for some stations in stops.csv have been shortened to fit better on the display.
    - Ensure to change the data links on line 10 of [mtacalls.py](/mtacalls2.py#10) if your station is not on the B,D,F,M,N,Q,R,W. These subway feed links can be found [here](https://api.mta.info/#/subwayRealTimeFeeds).
- Modify the time filter for how long it takes you to get to your station (change mintoarrival on line 54 of [mtacalls2.py](/mtacalls2.py#54))
- Modify the font - I like the font spleen. Change on line 86 of [rundisplay.py](/rundisplay.py#86)
- Create a cron job to run the program on boot, have a button for soft power down (GPIO 26), and reboot every 24 hours.

## To-Do

While this project is functionally "complete" there are several more improvements that can be made:

- The button for a soft power down (and potentially rebooting every 24 hours) is not fully working in the cron job. While this isn't a must-have, it is a nice-to-have. As cutting power to the pi without shutting it down first can corrupt the SD card. As a workaround, you could ssh in and power down prior to cutting power.
- The LED panel has quite a bit of flicker. While some of this is likely caused by the pi zero w, some of this is also likely caused by inefficient resource utilization and could be optimized.'
    - Update: The flicker was improved by adding in the ``--led-no-drop-privs`` flag to the command, so the problem is not as bad as it originally was.
- There is a long delay after the last times are displayed before it loops again. This could be shortened by optimizing code paths.
- Enclosure improvements: Overall fit and finish could be improved, as well as the rigidity.
- Code cleanup: For example, while this version does not use the disruption code, it is still included.
